I'm a Computer Science 1st year undergrad at [Amrita University, Amritapuri](https://www.amrita.edu/campus/amritapuri). From the display picture, you've probably figured out that Pokémon continues to fascinate me at this age xD. A Potterhead, who enjoys cooking and music, I like referring to myself in the third person whenever possible.
