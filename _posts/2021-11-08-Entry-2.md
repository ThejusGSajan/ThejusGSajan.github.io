title: Arch Linux on VirtualBox
---

Arch Linux is a light-weight Linux distro based on the [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) principle made for x64-86 processors. It uses a rolling release model, meaning there are no "major releases" of completely new versions of the system; a regular system update is all that is needed to obtain the latest Arch software. Arch Linux uses [pacman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux#Pacman) as its **pac**kage **man**ager, which was written specifically for Arch and is used to remove, install and update software packages.

## Installing Arch Linux on VirtualBox
---

### Downloading Arch Linux
---

We first need the Arch Linux ISO file which can be downloaded from Arch's [official website](https://archlinux.org/download/). You can either directly download or download the torrent, which is on a secure server. Please make sure to have a decent amount of storage space (at least 20GB) and an optimum amount of RAM (not less than 6GB) before the installation. (It is not advised to run VirtualBox on a machine with less than 4GB RAM but that's not to say that there are people who make it work.) 

I chose to torrent the ISO file, and those choosing to do so are requested by the Arch devs to seed the file for a little while too.

### Initializing a Virtual Machine on VirtualBox 
---

Open the Oracle VM VirtualBox manager and click on `New`. Type in the name of the operating system for the virtual machine you want to create which, in this case, is Arch Linux. VirtualBox automatically picks up the type and version of the OS, and you can also set where the machine will be stored in your drives. Click on `Next`.

![Arch VB initialization](/images/post2/arch42.png "VirtualBox initialisation")

Next, allocate the desired amount of RAM for your new operating system, which is ideally 1024 MB but anywhere in the green region is OK. I set it to half of my available RAM size which is 6GB. Click on `Next`.

![Arch RAM Allocation](/images/post2/arch43.png "RAM Allocation")

A new pop up appears asking if you'd like to create a virtual hard disk for your new virtual machine. Select `Create a virtual hard disk now` (selected by default) and click on `Create`.

![Arch Virtual Hard Disk](/images/post2/arch44.png "Virtual Hard Disk Creation")

On the next page, you will be prompted to select the type of hard disk you would like to use for your Virtual Hard Disk. `VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)` is usually selected. Click on `Next`.

![Arch VHD type](/images/post2/arch45.png "Virtual Hard Disk Type Selection")

Next, you will be asked to choose the type of storage allocation system for your Virtual Hard Disk and two options are given:
- Dynamically Allocated (space is only used on the hard disk as the storage on the Virtual Machine fills up [upto a maximum size] but won't shrink again even if space is freed up in the Virtual Hard Disk)
- Fixed size (a disk of fixed size, usually slower to create but faster in usage speeds)

Choose your desired option and click `Next`.

![Arch Storage Allocation](/images/post2/arch46.png "Storage Allocation Type")

The next tab requires your input on the size of the Virtual Hard Disk - a healthy 20GB will suffice (although you can dedicate more :P). You can also choose the location of storage on your host drive. Click on `Create` when your happy with the settings.

![Arch Storage Size](/images/post2/arch47.png "Storage Size")

We come out of the Virtual Machine Creation wizard and back to the VirtualBox Manager. You will notice that our Virtual Machine has been created (along with other Virtual Machines if you have added them before).

![Arch Virtual Machine](/images/post2/arch48.png "Virtual Machine Added")

Click `Start` to power on the virtual machine. When the machine powers on, you will be asked to choose your start-up disk. Navigate to the drive where you had downloaded the Arch Linux ISO file, by clicking on the folder icon and choose the ISO file, and then click on `Start`.

![Arch ISO file](/images/post2/arch49.png "Choosing the Start-Up Disk")


## Booting into Arch
---

After choosing the start-up disk, the virtual machine boots up into the boot menu. Choose `Boot Arch Linux (x86_64)` which is used to install the 64-bit version of the OS, and hit `enter`.

![Arch Boot](/images/post2/arch50.png "Arch Linux Boot Menu")

The system starts booting into a temporary live version and we are logged in as the root user.

![Arch Boot Page](/images/post2/arch51.png "Booting...")

We finally land on `tty1`, giving instructions on where to find the [official installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) (which is being followed in this procedure)

![Arch Welcome Message](/images/post2/arch1.png "tty1")

### Disk Partitioning
---

Firstly, check your internet connection using the `ping` command,

```bash
ping google.com
```
and press Ctrl+C (^C) to stop the script.

Or alternatively type in:

```bash
ping google.com -cx
```
which runs the script `x` times, where `x` stands for the number of times you want to ping `https://www/google.com`, and then exits the script.

![Arch net connectivity](/images/post2/arch2.png "ping google.com")

To see your current disk partition, use the `fdisk -l` command.

```bash
fdisk -l
```
![Arch disk partitions](/images/post2/arch3.png "Current Disk Partitions")

We see the `/dev/sda` disk which has the 20GB we allocated during the VirtualBox initialization. We will now partition this 20GB into three partitions - the first one is the primary root partition that will be of 10 GB. The second will be the swap partition, which should ideally be twice the initial RAM allocation, but I will go with 2GB. The third will be the logical partition which will be the remaining 8GB. To partition the drives, use the `cfdisk` command.

```bash
cfdisk
```
![Arch partition command](/images/post2/arch4.png "Partition command")

You will see a partition type menu with the following options:
- gpt
- dos
- sgi
- sun

Navigate to `dos` and hit `enter`.

![Arch partition type menu](/images/post2/arch5.png "Partition type menu")

Now we get to see the Partition Menu. The free disk space available is 20GB.

![Arch Partition Menu](/images/post2/arch6.png "Partition Menu")

Navigate to `New` on the options menu on the bottoms and press `enter`. Give the partition size as `10G`, where G stands for Gigabytes.

![Arch partition1](/images/post2/arch7.png "Partition 1")

Press `enter` and choose `primary` partition.

![Arch partition1](/images/post2/arch8.png "Partition 1 - Primary")

Now navigate to `Bootable` on the bottom options menu and press `enter`. This makes `/dev/sda1` a boot partition.

![Arch partition1](/images/post2/arch9.png "Partition 1 - Bootable")

Next, navigate to `Write` on the bottoms options menu and press `enter`. Type in `yes` and hit `enter`. This writes the `/dev/sda1` partition to disk.

![Arch partition1](/images/post2/arch11.png "Partition1 - writing to disk")

The 10GB primary boot partition has been created successfully.

![Arch partition1](/images/post2/arch12.png "Partition1 - successful")

Now navigate back to `Free Space` which has now reduced to 10GB and repeat all the above processes (except setting as boot partitions) for the next two partitions - 2GB and 8GB. **Don't forget to `Write` the partitions to disk!**

After all the partitions have been made, navigate to `Quit` on the bottom options menu and press `enter`.

![Arch partition menu quit](/images/post2/arch22.png "Exiting Partition Menu")


*P.S. You can use the `clear` command when and where you feel necessary to clean up the terminal window*

![Arch clearing terminal](/images/post2/arch23.png "Clearing the terminal")

Next, we format the newly created partitions.

```bash
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
```

here, `mkfs` stands for **make file system**, `ext4` is a *file system type* and `/dev/sda1` is the partition name. Repeat the same for the second drive.

```bash
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3
```
and for the swap partition,
```bash
mkswap /dev/sda2
```
here, `mkswap` is the **make swap** command which creates a swap area in the `/dev/sda2` partition. Swap area is the storage space which is used by the OS when the RAM is completely filled.

Now, activate the swap area by using the `swapon` command.
```bash
swapon /dev/sda2
```

![Arch partition formatting](/images/post2/arch24.png "Partition Formatting")

Now, we need to mount the primary partition.
```bash
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
mkdir /mnt/home
mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/home
```
![Arch primary partition mounting](/images/post2/arch25.png "Mounting primary partition")

### Bootstraping the OS
---

We have reached the actual installation part of Arch now xD. We use the `pacstrap` command which is designed to create a new system installation from scratch. The base-devel package does not contain many of the needed packages and hence those won't be installed. I have chosen to install the linux-kernel, a text editor (nano), a browser (firefox), man-db for the `man` command and some others. A full list of available optional packages can be found [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide#Install_essential_packages).

```bash
pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-kernel nano which man-db man-pages texinfo firefox dhcpcd
```
![Arch pacstrap](/images/post2/arch26.png "pacstrap command")

You can see the data packages being synchronised:

![Arch data package sync](/images/post2/arch27.png "Data package sync")

The installation proess starts and can take a few minutes to complete.

![Arch installation](/images/post2/arch28.png "Arch installation")

After the installation, we need to create the `fstab` file. It is a system configuration file which contains all the available disks, their partitions and options, designed to ease the burden of mounting and unmounting partitions. `fstab` stands for **f**ile **s**ystem **tab**le.

```bash
genfstab /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```

### Time and Language Settings
---

Change the system root to the Arch Linux install directory by using the `chroot` (**ch**ange **root**) command.
```bash
arch-chroot /mnt /bin/bash
```
To configure the language settings, open the `locale.gen` file with nano.
```bash
nano /etc/locale.gen
```
![Arch language settings](/images/post2/arch29.png "language settings")

Select the `en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8` language configuration (or any other of your choice) by deleting the `#` preceeding it and exiting from nano by pressing `Ctrl+X`. When prompted whether to save the buffer or not, press `y` and hit `enter`. Now activate the file by typing:

```bash
locale-gen
```
and press `enter`.

Now create the locale.conf file at /etc and add your chosen language to the system.
```bash
nano /etc/locale.conf
```
![Arch locale.conf file](/images/post2/arch31.png "creating locale.conf file")

Add the following line:

```bash
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```
![Arch language settings](/images/post2/arch32.png "language settings")

and exit from nano by pressing `Ctrl+X`, save the changes by pressing `y` and hit `enter`.

To get a list of time-zones around the world, type:
```bash
ls /usr/share/zoneinfo
```

If you want to see the time-zones within a specific continent, like say, Asia, type:
```bash
ls /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia
```
Once you've figured out the time-zone you want to set, use the `ln` command:
```bash
ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Kolkata /etc/localtime
```
![Arch time zone](/images/post2/arch33.png "setting time-zone")

To synchronise the time with network obtained time, turn on `ntp` (**n**etwork **t**ime **p**rotocol):
```bash
timedatectl set-ntp true
```
And now set the time standard using the `hwclock` (**h**ard**w**are **clock**) command to synchronise the hardware clock.
```bash
hwclock --systohc --utc
```
![Arch hwclock](/images/post2/arch34.png "hwclock")

### Password, Hostname and Netwroking
---

Set the root user password by using the `passwd` command.
```bash
passwd
```
Press `enter`, type the password and enter it again to confirm it.

![Arch passwd](/images/post2/arch35.png "creating a new root user password")

Enter the hostname of the network by typing:
```bash
nano /etc/hostname
```
Add a line containing the hostname and press `Ctrl+C`, press `y` and hit enter to save the changes.

![Arch hostname](/images/post2/arch36.png "configuring hostname")

`dhcpcd` is a DHCP (**d**ynamic **h**ost **c**onfiguration **p**rotocol - a network management protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses) and DHCPv6 client . Enable `dhcpcd` by typing:
```bash
systemctl enable dhcpcd
```

![Arch dhcpcd](/images/post2/arch37.png "enabling dhcpcd")

### Bootloader Installation
---

The final step is to download and install a linux-compatible bootloader. I'm going with grub as it's the most common and popular. Use the `pacman` command:
```bash
pacman -S grub os-prober
```
> `os-prober` is used, as the name suggests, to probe for OSs to display in the GRUB menu in the case of dual boots and such.

press `y`, hit `enter` and the install begins.

![Arch grub installation](/images/post2/arch38.png "Grub installation")

Install the grub bootloader to the disk:
```bash
grub-install /dev/sda
```
Configure the same by typing:
```bash
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
![Arch grub config](/images/post2/arch39.png "Grub configuration")

Now, we can exit from the `chroot` and reboot the virtual machine:

```bash
exit
```
and then
```bash
reboot
```

### Booting into installed Arch
---

When the boot menu appears this time, choose `Boot existing OS` and hit `enter`.

![Arch Booting](/images/post2/arch52.png "booting into installed Arch")

Login using the root login and password and you're in your newly installed Arch Linux OS.

## Closing Thoughts
---

Installing Arch Linux in itself might seem to be a herculean task. But the whole process helps one to gain new info on a variety of new things. And once you learn to setup and use Arch, the whole process of using the OS becomes a whole lot easier.Also you can finally say,
>"I use Arch btw"

xD. Just keep in mind that the [wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) is your best friend if you run into any trouble.

Cheers!
