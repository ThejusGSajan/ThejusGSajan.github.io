title: if Linux != Windows Learn to be Self-Sufficient
---

As soon as I saw the 0th task, I set out to find out the best Linux distro for beginners. Although the recommended distro in the task intructions was Ubuntu, through a bit of research, I discovered some of the cons of the widely beginner-friendly distro - the Software Center on Ubuntu took a lot of time to load and hogged up a lot of system resources; also, the fact that Ubuntu tries to default to the `snap` package management system, which is shunned by most Linux power-users, made me drift away from the distro - if I were going to use Linux, I was going to do it right (absolutely no offense to the Ubuntu power-users out there - this is just my opinion).

After a bit of reading through all the different distros out there (there are so many!) for absolute beginners, I noticed that two of the names kept repeating - both of them being the top two in the most used distros according to [DistroWatch.com](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major). One was of course the all time favourite Ubuntu, while the other was a distro I was hearing for the first time - Linux Mint. A little bit of digging revealed that the Cinnamon desktop was lighter and faster compared to GNOME and it used the `apt` package management system. Also, being based on Ubuntu itself, I figured that it would not be as different from Ubuntu and would be easy to troubleshoot.
