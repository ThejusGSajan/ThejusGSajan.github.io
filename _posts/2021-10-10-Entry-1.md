title: if Linux != Windows, Learn to be Self-Sufficient
---

As soon as I saw the 0th task, I set out to find out the best Linux distro for beginners. Although the recommended distro in the task intructions was Ubuntu, through a bit of research, I discovered some of the cons of the widely beginner-friendly distro - the Software Center on Ubuntu took a lot of time to load and hogged up a lot of system resources; also, the fact that Ubuntu tries to default to the `snap` package management system, which is shunned by most Linux power-users, made me drift away from the distro - if I were going to use Linux, I was going to do it right (absolutely no offense to the Ubuntu power-users out there - this is just my opinion).

After a bit of reading through all the different distros out there (there are so many!) for absolute beginners, I noticed that two of the names kept repeating - both of them being the top two in the most used distros according to [DistroWatch.com](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major). One was of course the all time favourite Ubuntu, while the other was a distro I was hearing for the first time - Linux Mint. A little bit of digging revealed that the Cinnamon desktop was lighter and faster compared to GNOME and it used the `apt` package management system. Also, being based on Ubuntu itself, I figured that it would not be as different from Ubuntu and would be easy to troubleshoot.

Downloading the ISO file of any Linux distro is relatively easy, one just goes to the website of the respective distro and finds a "Download" tab or something related to that and downloads the file with the click of a button. So in my case, I went to [linuxmint.com](https://linuxmint.com) and went to the [Download](https://linuxmint.com/download.php) section and downloaded the latest Cinnamon flavour of the OS.

An ISO file is a single file which is a perfect representation of an entire CD (as CDs used to be made use of to install softwares and OS's). Therefore we will need to mount this ISO image file onto a tangible hard drive - this process is called "burning". There are various tools used for burning, but I used a nifty little tool called [Rufus](https://rufus.ie) to burn my Linux Mint ISO file onto a pendrive.

When burning an ISO file for an OS installation, one must always keep in mind the partition scheme used in our devices - MBR and GUID. After setting the optimal options in the Rufus tool, click "Start" and wait till the ISO file is burned onto the pendrive/CD/any hardware of your choice.
