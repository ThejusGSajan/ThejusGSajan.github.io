## Expectation
Being kind of new to the whole blogging experience when it has been a staple for netizens around the world for years, please don't expect world class blog entries with eye-catching visuals and my very own domain. Let a brother catch up. Hopefully, I can manage to develop this into more of an actual blog website pretty soon, once I get the hang of it ^_^".
